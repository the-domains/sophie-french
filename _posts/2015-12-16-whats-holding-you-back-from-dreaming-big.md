# Think Big!

A couple of weeks ago I attended a Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) Practitioner Course, of which I spent every day being absolutely in awe and learning so much! (More about that soon!)
Over the course, we talked a lot about creating metaphors for life -- ones that empower and inspire us. And this week I got to thinking about a fabulously empowering metaphor that encapsulates this incredible course for me and has essentially fuelled me to 'up my game'. 

You see, I started the week with an exercise where we were to imagine going into a travel agents and booking a holiday...
Want to know where my IMAGINARY holiday was?
A 3\* all-inclusive resort in Turkey for Â£500\. 

Yep, it was my IMAGINATION, and I didn't even think big about it, I didn't 'make up' a dream destination, didn't run wild with my vision or fantasise about an exotic paradise. And that's something that really struck a chord with me, because whilst others were pretend booking their 5 star months in the Caribbean, I was literally dreaming up 'standard'.
And really, if I couldn't even IMAGINE booking more than a 3\* holiday, how could I possibly expect to strive for any more than that in my reality?
