# About Me HERE

In case I hadn't mentioned it (only a million times) I spent this year travelling.

I stripped back of_stuff_and carried my life around in a suitcase (okay, so_it was_a big suitcase, but that's beside the point), I eliminated routine from my life by leaving my full-time PR job in the UK and working my own hours as a freelance writer instead, and I left my friends and family behind to embark on this new adventure with my boyfriend by my side.

So basically, I took a leap into the unknown. And everything changed. In the best kind of way!

It's funny how they say that travel changes you. I was a little sceptical about that statement to say the least, it probably made me do an eyeroll. I mean, I just wanted to lie on a beach and live by the sea, what's all the fuss about? But seriously, it's true -- travel is a game-changer on, like, everything!  (Hey, I saw that eyeroll.)

Hear me out: quite simply, when you travel, you step back from the madness, and without all your stuff and people and plans, you're just, well, you. And you uncover the kinds of things you never had the chance to notice: like how much you thrive on laughter with your oldest bestest friends and that that can't be recreated, that you have a_choice_to map out your own life instead of following the crowd, and that you have to take care of yourself before you can be the best for anyone else.

There you go, now you needn't spend Â£10,000 on a trip around the world.
